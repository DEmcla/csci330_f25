## üéØ Core Assignment 1: Banking System with RAII (2 hours)

*Comprehensive banking application demonstrating constructors, destructors, and resource management*

### Part A: Account Hierarchy and Lifecycle (60 minutes)

**Objective**: Master constructor/destructor patterns through a complete banking system

Create a program called `banking_system.cpp` that implements:

**Base Account Class:**

1. Create a `BankAccount` base class with:
   - Multiple constructors (default, balance, full account info)
   - Copy constructor and assignment operator
   - Virtual destructor with logging
   - Account number generation (static counter)
   - Balance management with validation

**Specialized Account Types:**
2. Implement derived classes:

- `SavingsAccount` (with interest rate)
- `CheckingAccount` (with overdraft protection)
- `BusinessAccount` (with transaction limits)

**Lifecycle Demonstration:**
3. Create accounts using different constructors
4. Show object creation/destruction order in nested scopes
5. Demonstrate copy behavior and resource management
6. Track total accounts created/destroyed (static members)

### Part B: Transaction Management and RAII (60 minutes)  

**Objective**: Apply RAII principles for transaction safety and logging

Extend your banking system with automatic resource management:

**Transaction Logger (RAII):**

1. Create a `TransactionLogger` class that:
   - Opens log file in constructor
   - Automatically closes file in destructor
   - Ensures all transactions are logged even if exceptions occur
   - Demonstrates stack-based resource management

**Safe Transaction Operations:**
2. Implement transaction safety:

- Atomic transfer operations (all-or-nothing)
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Exception-safe balance updates
- Resource cleanup even when operations fail

**Advanced RAII Patterns:**
3. Create utility classes demonstrating RAII:

- `AccountLock` (prevents concurrent access)
- `BalanceBackup` (automatic restoration on failure)
- `AuditTrail` (automatic compliance logging)

**Expected Output** (partial):

```
=== Banking System with RAII Demo ===
[Constructor] Account #1001 created: John Doe, $1000.00
[Constructor] Account #1002 created: Jane Smith, $1500.00
[Constructor] Business Account #1003: Acme Corp, $10000.00

[Transaction Log] Transfer initiated: #1001 -> #1002, $200.00
[RAII Logger] Transaction log opened: bank_transactions.log
[Success] Transfer completed successfully
[RAII Logger] Transaction log closed automatically

[Destructor] Account #1003 destroyed: Final balance $9800.00
[Destructor] Account #1002 destroyed: Final balance $1700.00  
[Destructor] Account #1001 destroyed: Final balance $800.00

Summary: 3 accounts created, 3 accounts destroyed, 1 transfer completed
```

**Skills Developed**: Constructor overloading, virtual destructors, RAII patterns, exception safety

## üéØ Core Assignment 2: Resource Management Framework (2 hours)

*Advanced memory management system showcasing dynamic allocation and smart resource handling*

### Part A: Dynamic Memory Manager (60 minutes)

**Objective**: Build a comprehensive memory management system with proper cleanup

Create `resource_manager.cpp` implementing:

**Resource Manager Class:**

1. Design a `ResourceManager` template class that:
   - Manages dynamic arrays of any type
   - Provides safe allocation/deallocation
   - Prevents memory leaks through RAII
   - Supports resizing and copying

**Dynamic Student Database:**
2. Apply the resource manager to build:

- Dynamic student record system
- Automatic capacity expansion
- Safe copying and assignment
- Memory usage tracking and reporting

**Memory Safety Demonstrations:**
3. Create scenarios showing:

- What happens without proper cleanup (controlled leaks)
- Automatic cleanup with RAII
- Exception safety during allocation
- Resource cleanup in complex inheritance hierarchies

### Part B: Advanced Lifecycle Patterns (60 minutes)

**Objective**: Master complex object relationships and lifecycle dependencies

Extend your resource manager with advanced patterns:

**Dependency Management:**

1. Implement objects with dependencies:
   - Parent objects that own child objects
   - Shared resources with reference counting
   - Circular dependency detection and prevention
   - Ordered destruction based on dependencies

**Factory Pattern with RAII:**
2. Create object factories that:

- Manage object creation and registration
- Provide automatic cleanup on program exit
- Handle creation failures gracefully
- Maintain object inventories and statistics

**Integration with Banking System:**
3. Combine both assignments:

- Use resource manager for account storage
- Implement account pools with automatic cleanup
- Create report generators with RAII file handling
- Build complete system with proper resource lifecycle

**Performance Analysis:**
4. Compare different approaches:

- Stack vs heap allocation performance
- RAII overhead vs manual management
- Memory fragmentation analysis
- Constructor/destructor call overhead

**Files**: `banking_system.cpp`, `resource_manager.cpp`
**Time Estimate**: 4 hours total (2 + 2)
**Skills Developed**: Advanced RAII, memory management, object relationships, performance optimization

3. Add `weak_ptr` to break circular references
4. Build comprehensive test suite
5. Compare performance with raw pointers

### Challenge 2: Exception-Safe Programming (40 minutes)

**Objective**: Master exception safety guarantees

Create robust classes with different safety levels:

1. Basic guarantee (no leaks, but object may be in altered state)
2. Strong guarantee (rollback on exception)  
3. No-throw guarantee (operations never fail)
4. Implement exception-safe container class
5. Build automatic testing for exception scenarios

### Challenge 3: Custom Memory Allocators (50 minutes)
