## Learning Objectives
- Master if/else statements and conditional logic
- Implement various loop constructs (for, while, do-while)
- Use switch statements effectively
- Understand scope and variable lifetime in blocks
- Apply break, continue, and goto statements appropriately

## Assignment Tasks
Complete THREE problem sets (2.25 hours total):

### Problem Set 1: Conditional Statements (45 minutes)
1. **If/Else Chains**: Multi-way decision making
2. **Switch Statements**: Efficient selection structures
3. **Conditional Operators**: Ternary and logical combinations

### Problem Set 2: Loop Constructs (45 minutes)
1. **For Loops**: Traditional and range-based iterations
2. **While/Do-While**: Condition-controlled loops
3. **Loop Control**: Break, continue, and nested loops

### Problem Set 3: Advanced Flow Control (45 minutes)
1. **Scope Management**: Block scope and variable lifetime
2. **Exception Handling Preview**: Try/catch basics
3. **Modern Constructs**: Structured bindings and if-init

## Building and Testing

mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./statements_demo
make test
