| **Debug** | `F5` | `F5` | Run with debugging |
| **Terminal** | `Ctrl+`` (backtick) | `Cmd+`` | Toggle integrated terminal |

#### **Navigation and Editing**
| Action | Windows/Linux | macOS | What It Does |
|--------|---------------|-------|-------------|
| **Command Palette** | `Ctrl+Shift+P` | `Cmd+Shift+P` | Access all commands |
| **Quick Open** | `Ctrl+P` | `Cmd+P` | Quickly open files |
| **Go to Line** | `Ctrl+G` | `Cmd+G` | Jump to specific line |
| **Find/Replace** | `Ctrl+F` / `Ctrl+H` | `Cmd+F` / `Cmd+Option+F` | Search and replace |

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint 1: Shortcut Practice
**Test**: Use shortcuts to build and run a simple program

1. Create a new file called `shortcut_test.cpp`:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::cout << "Testing VS Code shortcuts!\n";
    return 0;
}
```

2. **Practice the workflow:**

## üêõ Section 2: Integrated Debugging Mastery (15 minutes)

### Setting Up Debug Configuration

VS Code's integrated debugger is incredibly powerful. Here's how to master it:

#### **Basic Debugging Workflow**

1. **Set Breakpoints**: Click left of line numbers (red dot appears)
2. **Start Debugging**: Press `F5`
3. **Step Through Code**: Use `F10` (step over), `F11` (step into)
4. **Inspect Variables**: Hover over variables or check Variables panel

### Hands-On Debug Practice

Create this program for debugging practice:

```cpp
// debug_practice.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int calculate_sum(const std::vector<int>& numbers) {
    int total = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
        total += numbers[i];
    }
    return total;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> values = {10, 20, 30, 40};
    int result = calculate_sum(values);
    std::cout << "Sum is: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Debug Session Steps:**

1. **Set breakpoints** on these lines:
   - Line with `int result = calculate_sum(values);`
   - Line with `total += numbers[i];` (inside the loop)
   - Line with `return total;`

2. **Start debugging** with `F5`

3. **When program stops at first breakpoint:**
   - Look at the Variables panel - can you see `values` array?
   - Press `F11` to step INTO the function

4. **Inside the function:**
   - Use `F10` to step through the loop
   - Watch how `total` changes in Variables panel
   - Watch how `i` increments each iteration

5. **Advanced inspection:**
   - Hover over `numbers[i]` to see current value
   - In the Debug Console, type `total` to see current value
   - Try typing `numbers.size()` in Debug Console

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint 2: Debug Workflow Mastery
**Test**: Successfully debug a program with intentional bug

Modify the calculate_sum function to have a bug:
```cpp
int calculate_sum(const std::vector<int>& numbers) {
    int total = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < numbers.size(); i++) {  // Bug: starts at 1 instead of 0
        total += numbers[i];
    }
    return total;
}
```

**Your task:**
- [ ] Set breakpoints and run debugger
- [ ] Step through the loop and observe what's happening
- [ ] Identify that first element (index 0) is being skipped
- [ ] Fix the bug by changing `i = 1` to `i = 0`
- [ ] Verify fix by running debugger again

**Success Criteria**: You can identify and fix the bug using VS Code's debugging tools.

## üìÅ Section 3: Project Navigation & File Management (10 minutes)

### Efficient Project Navigation

As your programs get larger, efficient navigation becomes crucial:

#### **Multi-file Project Setup**
```
my_project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.cpp
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ calculator.cpp
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ calculator.h
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.cpp
```

#### **Navigation Shortcuts**
| Action | Shortcut | Usage |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Quick Open** | `Ctrl+P` / `Cmd+P` | Type filename to open |
| **Go to Definition** | `F12` | Jump to function/variable definition |
| **Go to Declaration** | `Ctrl+F12` / `Cmd+F12` | Jump to declaration |
| **Find All References** | `Shift+F12` | See all uses of symbol |
| **Navigate Back** | `Alt+Left` / `Ctrl+-` | Return to previous location |

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint 3: Navigation Practice
**Test**: Navigate efficiently in a multi-file project

1. Create these files in a folder:

**main.cpp:**
```cpp
#include "calculator.h"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int result = add(5, 3);
    std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**calculator.h:**
```cpp
#ifndef CALCULATOR_H
#define CALCULATOR_H

int add(int a, int b);

#endif
```

**calculator.cpp:**
```cpp
#include "calculator.h"

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

2. **Navigation tests:**
   - [ ] In main.cpp, press `F12` while cursor is on `add` - jumps to definition
   - [ ] Use `Ctrl+P` / `Cmd+P` and type "calc" - quickly opens calculator files
   - [ ] Use `Alt+Left` / `Ctrl+-` to navigate back
   - [ ] Right-click on `add` and select "Find All References"

**Success Criteria**: You can navigate between files quickly without using file explorer.
