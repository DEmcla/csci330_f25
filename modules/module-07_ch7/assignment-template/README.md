# HW_07: Expressions and Operators

## Overview
This assignment explores expressions, operators, and precedence as covered in Chapter 7 of "C++ Crash Course".

## Learning Objectives
- Master operator precedence and associativity
- Implement operator overloading for custom types
- Understand expression evaluation order
- Work with bitwise operations
- Apply compound and ternary operators

## Assignment Tasks
Complete THREE problem sets (2.25 hours total):

### Problem Set 1: Operator Basics (45 minutes)
1. **Precedence Lab**: Expression evaluation exercises
2. **Compound Operators**: +=, -=, *=, /= usage
3. **Ternary Operator**: Conditional expressions

### Problem Set 2: Operator Overloading (45 minutes)
1. **Complex Numbers**: Overload +, -, *, / for complex
2. **Vector Math**: 2D/3D vector operations
3. **Stream Operators**: << and >> for custom types

### Problem Set 3: Bitwise Operations (45 minutes)
1. **Flag Management**: Using bits for flags
2. **Bit Manipulation**: Set, clear, toggle, check bits
3. **Efficient Math**: Multiplication/division with shifts
