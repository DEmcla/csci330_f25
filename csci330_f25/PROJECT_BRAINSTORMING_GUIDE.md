# CSCI 330 - Project Brainstorming Guide

## üéØ Finding Your Audacious Project

This is your chance to build something substantial and portfolio-worthy. Don't think small - think about problems you actually want to solve or tools you wish existed.

## üîç Discovery Questions

### Start with Problems You Face
- What repetitive tasks do you do that could be automated?
- What tools do you wish existed for your hobbies or other coursework?
- What data do you work with that's hard to analyze or visualize?
- What games do you play that could be improved or reimplemented?
- What would make your development workflow more efficient?

### Consider Your Domain Interests
- **Computer Science Student**: Compiler tools, algorithm visualizers, code analyzers
- **Data Science/Analytics**: Custom data processing pipelines, visualization tools
- **Cybersecurity**: Security analysis tools, cryptographic implementations
- **Gaming**: Game engines, AI for games, procedural generation
- **Research**: Domain-specific analysis tools, simulation platforms
- **Arts/Media**: Image/audio processing, creative coding tools

### Think About Scale and Impact
- Could other people actually use this?
- Would this solve a real problem you have?
- Could this be extended beyond the semester?
- Does this demonstrate sophisticated programming skills?

## üí° Brainstorming Techniques

### The "What If" Approach
- What if I rebuilt [familiar tool] with modern C++?
- What if I combined [two different domains]?
- What if I automated [manual process I know well]?
- What if I visualized [complex data/concept]?

### The Missing Tool Approach
- "I wish there was a tool that could..."
- "Why is [process] so complicated? I could build..."
- "Every time I [do task], I think there should be..."

### The Learning Challenge Approach
- What's a concept I want to understand better through implementation?
- What's a technology I want to learn while building something useful?
- What's a domain I want to explore through code?

## üèóÔ∏è Project Categories with Examples

### Systems & Performance

- Build system improvements
- Documentation generators
- Development environment utilities

### Data & Analytics
Processing and understanding information:
- Custom database implementations
- Data visualization frameworks
- Stream processing systems
- Analytics engines for specific domains

### Interactive Applications
Real-time user interfaces and experiences:
- Game engines or frameworks
- Interactive simulations
- Real-time data dashboards
- Educational software

### Network & Communication
Distributed systems and protocols:
- Custom protocols or clients
- Peer-to-peer applications
- Real-time communication tools
- Distributed computing frameworks

### Domain-Specific Solutions
Applications for specific fields:
- Scientific computation tools
- Financial analysis systems
- Creative tools (graphics, audio, text)
- Educational platforms

## üîß Technical Considerations

### Core Challenge First
Your Phase 1 proof-of-concept should tackle the hardest part:
- **Game**: Physics/collision detection, not the UI
- **Database**: Storage and retrieval algorithms, not the query language
- **Network App**: The protocol and connection handling, not the interface
- **Compiler**: Parsing and code generation, not syntax highlighting

### Scalability Planning
Design for growth from day one:
- How will this handle larger datasets?
- How will performance scale?
- How will you add features without rewriting everything?
- What parts need to be optimized first?

### Platform Considerations
- Will this run on multiple operating systems?
- Do you need special libraries or dependencies?
- Are there performance requirements?
- Do you need a GUI or is command-line sufficient?

## üìù Evaluation Criteria

### Is This Project Audacious Enough?
Ask yourself:
- **Complexity**: Will this challenge me for 15 weeks?
- **Scope**: Is this substantial enough to impress in interviews?
- **Learning**: Will I master new concepts building this?
- **Impact**: Could someone actually use this?

### Red Flags to Avoid
- **Too Simple**: "Just" adding features to existing code
- **Too Broad**: Trying to build the next Facebook
- **Too Narrow**: Single-purpose tools with obvious solutions
- **Too Dependent**: Requires external services that might fail

### Green Flags to Seek
- **Novel Combination**: Existing concepts applied in new ways
- **Personal Passion**: You're excited to work on this
- **Clear Growth Path**: Obvious progression from simple to sophisticated
- **Portfolio Value**: You'd be proud to show this to employers

## üí≠ Refinement Process

### Week 1: Generate Ideas
- Brainstorm 5-10 potential projects
- Don't filter yet - capture everything
- Talk to friends, family, professors about problems they have

### Week 2: Evaluate and Focus
- Apply evaluation criteria to each idea
- Research technical feasibility
- Identify the core technical challenges
- Choose your top 2-3 candidates

### Week 3: Prototype and Decide
- Build tiny prototypes for each candidate
- See which excites you most when coding
- Consider which aligns with your career goals
- Make your final decision

## üöÄ Making It Happen

### Set Ambitious but Achievable Goals
- Dream big for the final vision
- Plan conservatively for the MVP
- Build in buffer time for setbacks
- Have backup features ready

### Build Your Support Network
- Identify classmates with complementary skills
- Find domain experts who can give feedback
- Connect with professionals in related fields
- Use your instructor's expertise

### Document Everything
- Keep a project journal of decisions and discoveries
- Screenshot interesting bugs and solutions
- Track what you learn and when
- Note when and how you use AI assistance

## üéØ Final Reality Check

Before committing to your project, ask:

1. **Am I excited to spend 15 weeks on this?**
2. **Will this teach me skills I want to have?**
3. **Can I explain why this matters to someone else?**
4. **Do I have a clear vision of what success looks like?**
5. **Can I break this into concrete, measurable milestones?**

Remember: The best project is one that challenges you, excites you, and creates something you're genuinely proud to have built.
