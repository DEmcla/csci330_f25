## 🛣️ Your Learning Path

### **Step 1: Verify Your Environment** ⭐ NEW!

Before starting, check that everything is properly configured:
```bash
./test_integration.sh
```
This script verifies that all tools (Git, Docker, VS Code, C++) are properly installed and work together. If any tests fail, follow the setup instructions below.

### **Step 2: Choose Your Development Workflow**

You have **three workflow options**. Choose based on your comfort level and goals:

| Workflow | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|----------|----------|------|------|
| **🥇 VS Code + Docker** | **Most students** | Visual debugging, professional tools, consistent environment | Requires setup time |
| **🥈 Pure Docker/CLI** | Linux enthusiasts, minimalists | Lightweight, exact grading environment | Command-line only |
| **🥉 VS Code + Local** | Quick start, offline work | Fastest setup, no Docker | Platform differences |

**👉 Don't know which to choose?** Pick **VS Code + Docker** - it's designed for most students and provides the best learning experience.

### **Step 4: Start Chapter 1**

Once your environment is ready:
1. **Open**: [`chapter_01_lesson_plan.md`](chapter_01_lesson_plan.md)
2. **Work through**: All 4 modules at your own pace
3. **Complete**: [`chapter_01_problems_revised.md`](chapter_01_problems_revised.md)
4. **Verify**: All programs compile and run correctly

## 🧠 Learning Strategies for Python/Java Programmers

### **Leverage Your Existing Knowledge**
- **Variables**: You understand variables - now learn about stack vs heap
- **Functions**: You know functions - now see how C++ handles memory
- **Objects**: You use objects - now control their entire lifecycle
- **Collections**: You use lists/arrays - now choose the right container

### **Embrace the Differences**
- **Manual Memory Management**: Scary at first, but gives you control
- **Static Typing**: Restrictive feeling, but catches errors early  
- **Compilation**: Extra step, but results in faster programs
- **Pointers**: New concept, but opens up powerful patterns

### **Use Visual Debugging**
- **Don't just read code** - step through it with the debugger
- **Watch variables change** - see memory addresses and values
- **Understand object lifecycles** - watch constructors and destructors
- **Visualize data structures** - see how containers store elements

## 🎯 Success Tips

### **Weekly Routine**
1. **Monday/Tuesday**: Start new chapter lesson plan
2. **Wednesday/Thursday**: Complete problem sets
3. **Friday**: Review, debug issues, get help if needed
4. **Weekend**: Optional - explore advanced topics or get ahead

### **When You Get Stuck**
1. **Check Quick Help** - Each chapter has a reference card
2. **Use the debugger** - Step through your code to understand the issue
3. **Review Python/Java equivalents** - Connect to what you already know
4. **Ask for help** - Office hours, forums, study groups

### **Debugging Strategy**
1. **Always compile with debug symbols** - Use the provided build commands
2. **Set breakpoints liberally** - Don't just run code, step through it
3. **Watch variables** - Use VS Code's Variables and Watch panels
4. **Understand error messages** - C++ compiler errors are verbose but helpful

## 🚨 Common Beginner Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### **Environment Issues**
- ❌ **Skipping setup verification** → ✅ Always test with "Hello World" first
- ❌ **Using wrong compiler flags** → ✅ Use provided compilation commands
- ❌ **Working outside Docker** → ✅ Stay in consistent environment

### **C++ Language Issues**  
- ❌ **Ignoring compiler warnings** → ✅ Fix all warnings, treat them as errors
- ❌ **Not using the debugger** → ✅ Step through code to understand execution
- ❌ **Assuming Python/Java behavior** → ✅ Test C++ behavior explicitly

### **Learning Process Issues**
- ❌ **Rushing through concepts** → ✅ Take time to understand, don't just copy code
- ❌ **Skipping problem sets** → ✅ Hands-on practice is essential
- ❌ **Working in isolation** → ✅ Use study groups and office hours
