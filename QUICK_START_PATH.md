**Time**: ~10 hours total

### Stage 2: Object-Oriented Basics (Weeks 3-4)  
**Goal**: Create and use classes effectively
**Time**: ~10 hours total

### Stage 3: Modern C++ Essentials (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal**: Use smart pointers and STL containers
**Time**: ~10 hours total

### Stage 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 7+)
**Goal**: Master templates, polymorphism, and algorithms
**Time**: Ongoing development

## üìö Stage 1: Essential Skills (Weeks 1-2)

### Core Focus: "Get Things Working"
Learn the minimum needed to write, compile, and debug C++ programs.

#### From Chapter 1: Up and Running
**Essential concepts only**:
- [ ] Set up development environment (DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md)
- [ ] Write and compile "Hello World"
- [ ] Use `printf` for output
- [ ] Understand compilation vs interpretation

**Skip for now**: Advanced compilation options, multiple workflows

#### From Chapter 2: Types and Memory  
**Essential concepts only**:
- [ ] Declare variables: `int`, `double`, `string`
- [ ] Use the debugger to see variable values
- [ ] Create simple arrays: `int arr[5]`
- [ ] Understand stack vs heap (conceptually)

**Skip for now**: Pointers, memory addresses, complex memory management

#### Quick Practice Problems
Focus on **Problem Set 1** from each chapter only:
- Simple input/output programs
- Basic variable manipulation
- Array operations with bounds checking

### Stage 1 Success Check
- [ ] Can write, compile, and run C++ programs
- [ ] Can use debugger to inspect variables
- [ ] Understand basic types and arrays

## üìö Stage 2: Object-Oriented Basics (Weeks 3-4)

### Core Focus: "Create and Use Classes"
Learn to organize code into classes - the foundation of larger programs.

#### From Chapter 3: References (Simplified)
**Essential concepts only**:
- [ ] Pass parameters by reference: `void func(int& x)`
- [ ] Use `const` to prevent accidental changes: `const int& x`
- [ ] Understand why references are safer than pointers

**Skip for now**: Complex reference binding rules, advanced const usage

#### From Chapter 4: Object Lifecycle (Essential)
**Core class concepts**:
- [ ] Create classes with constructors: `Person(string name)`
- [ ] Use destructors for cleanup: `~Person()`
- [ ] Understand automatic resource management (RAII)
- [ ] Create objects on stack vs heap

**Skip for now**: Complex inheritance, operator overloading

#### Quick Practice Problems
Focus on **Problem Sets 1-2** from each chapter:
- Design simple classes (Person, BankAccount, etc.)
- Use constructors and destructors
- Pass objects by reference

### Stage 2 Success Check
- [ ] Can design and implement simple classes
- [ ] Understand constructor/destructor lifecycle
- [ ] Use references for function parameters
- [ ] Apply basic RAII principles

## üìö Stage 3: Modern C++ Essentials (Weeks 5-6)

### Core Focus: "Use Modern C++ Safely"
Learn the tools that make C++ safe and productive in 2024.

#### From Chapter 11: Smart Pointers (Essential)
**Modern memory management**:
- [ ] Replace `new/delete` with `unique_ptr`
- [ ] Use `make_unique` for object creation
- [ ] Understand automatic cleanup
- [ ] Know when to use `shared_ptr`

**Skip for now**: `weak_ptr`, complex ownership patterns

#### From Chapter 13: STL Containers (Essential)
**Essential containers**:
- [ ] Use `vector` as dynamic array
- [ ] Use `string` for text operations  
- [ ] Use `map` for key-value storage
- [ ] Understand when to use each container

**Skip for now**: Advanced containers, performance analysis

#### From Chapter 14: Iterators (Simplified)
**Modern iteration**:
- [ ] Use range-based for loops: `for(auto& item : container)`
- [ ] Understand `auto` keyword
- [ ] Know when to use `const auto&` vs `auto&`

**Skip for now**: Traditional iterators, iterator categories

#### Quick Practice Problems
Focus on **Problem Sets 1-2**:
- Build programs using `vector` and `map`
- Replace raw pointers with smart pointers
- Use range-based for loops throughout

### Stage 3 Success Check
- [ ] Use smart pointers instead of raw pointers
- [ ] Work effectively with `vector`, `string`, and `map`
- [ ] Use range-based for loops naturally
- [ ] Write memory-safe C++ code

## üìö Stage 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 7+)

### Core Focus: "Master the Full Language"
Now that you're productive, learn the advanced features that make C++ powerful.

#### Add These Concepts Gradually:
- **Templates** (Chapter 6): Generic programming
- **Polymorphism** (Chapter 5): Inheritance and virtual functions
- **Advanced Functions** (Chapter 9): Lambdas and callbacks
- **Error Handling** (Chapter 8): Exceptions and RAII
- **STL Algorithms** (Beyond core containers)

#### Learning Strategy for Stage 4:
1. **Pick one advanced topic** per week
2. **Apply it to existing projects** - don't start from scratch
3. **Read full chapters** now that you have foundation
4. **Complete all problem sets** to deepen understanding

### Stage 4 Success Check
- [ ] Can use templates for generic code
- [ ] Understand inheritance and polymorphism
- [ ] Use lambdas and functional programming concepts
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully with exceptions
- [ ] Choose optimal STL algorithms for tasks
