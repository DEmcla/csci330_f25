# Chapter 2: Workflow-Specific Debugging Tips

## Overview

Chapter 2's memory concepts (pointers, arrays, structs) benefit greatly from debugging tools. This guide provides specific tips for each development workflow to help you master these challenging concepts.

---

## Workflow A: Pure Docker/Command Line

### Strengths for Chapter 2
- **Exact grading environment** - Your debugging matches instructor's setup
- **GDB mastery** - Learn professional debugging skills
- **Minimal overhead** - Fast compilation and execution

### GDB Commands for Memory Debugging

#### Basic GDB Setup
```bash
# Compile with debug symbols and address sanitizer
g++ -g -fsanitize=address -o program program.cpp

# Start GDB
gdb ./program
```

#### Essential GDB Commands for Chapter 2

**Variable Inspection:**
```gdb
(gdb) print variable_name       # Show value
(gdb) print &variable_name      # Show address
(gdb) print *pointer_name       # Dereference pointer
(gdb) print pointer_name        # Show pointer address
```

**Array Debugging:**
```gdb
(gdb) print array_name          # Show array address
(gdb) print array_name[0]       # First element
(gdb) print array_name@5        # Show 5 elements
(gdb) x/5i array_name           # Examine 5 integers in memory
```

**Memory Examination:**
```gdb
(gdb) x/4xw &variable           # Examine 4 words in hex
(gdb) x/10c string_var          # Examine 10 characters
(gdb) info registers            # See CPU registers
```

**Pointer Debugging:**
```gdb
(gdb) set $ptr = pointer_name   # Save pointer in convenience variable
(gdb) print $ptr                # Show saved pointer
(gdb) print *$ptr               # Dereference saved pointer
(gdb) watch *pointer_name       # Watch pointed-to value change
```

**Struct Debugging:**
```gdb
(gdb) print struct_var          # Show entire struct
(gdb) print struct_var.member   # Show specific member
(gdb) print &struct_var.member  # Address of member
```

### Workflow A Sample Session

```bash
student@container:~$ g++ -g -fsanitize=address -o pointers pointers.cpp
student@container:~$ gdb ./pointers

(gdb) break main
(gdb) run
(gdb) next                      # Step through program
(gdb) print value              # Check variable value
(gdb) print &value             # Check variable address
(gdb) print ptr                # Check pointer value
(gdb) print *ptr               # Check pointed-to value
(gdb) continue
```

### Memory Visualization in Terminal

**ASCII Memory Layout Visualization:**
```bash
# Create a simple script to show memory layout
echo "Address    | Value     | Variable"
echo "-----------|-----------|----------"
gdb -batch -ex "run" -ex "print &var1" -ex "print &var2" ./program
```

### Pros and Cons for Chapter 2

**Pros:**

### VS Code-Specific Setup for Chapter 2

#### Enhanced Launch Configuration
```json
{
    "name": "Debug Chapter 2 (Memory Focus)",
    "type": "cppdbg",
    "request": "launch",
    "program": "${workspaceFolder}/build/${fileBasenameNoExtension}",
    "args": [],
    "stopAtEntry": false,
    "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
    "environment": [],
    "externalConsole": false,
    "MIMode": "gdb",
    "setupCommands": [
        {
            "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
            "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
            "ignoreFailures": true
        },
        {
            "description": "Set print elements unlimited",
            "text": "-gdb-set print elements 0",
            "ignoreFailures": true
        },
        {
            "description": "Enable array visualization",
            "text": "-gdb-set print array on",
            "ignoreFailures": true
        }
    ],
    "preLaunchTask": "build with memory debugging",
    "miDebuggerPath": "/usr/bin/gdb"
}
```

#### Memory-Focused Build Task
```json
{
    "label": "build with memory debugging",
    "type": "shell",
    "command": "g++",
    "args": [
        "-std=c++17",
        "-g",
        "-O0",                    // No optimization for better debugging
        "-fsanitize=address",     // Catch memory errors
        "-fsanitize=undefined",   // Catch undefined behavior
        "-fno-omit-frame-pointer",
        "-Wall",
        "-Wextra",
        "-Warray-bounds",         // Extra array bounds checking
        "${file}",
        "-o",
        "${workspaceFolder}/build/${fileBasenameNoExtension}"
    ],
    "group": "build",
    "problemMatcher": ["$gcc"]
}
```

### Visual Debugging Techniques

#### Pointer Visualization Strategy
1. **Set breakpoint** before pointer operations
2. **Variables Panel**: Expand pointers to see both address and value
3. **Watch Panel**: Add expressions like:
   - `ptr` (shows address)
   - `*ptr` (shows value)
   - `&variable` (shows address of variable)
4. **Memory View**: Right-click variable → "View as Memory"

#### Array Debugging Workflow
1. **Breakpoint in loop**: Set breakpoint inside array processing loop
2. **Watch array index**: Add `i` to watch panel
3. **Monitor bounds**: Watch `i < array_size`
4. **View array contents**: Variables panel shows all elements
5. **Step through**: Use F10 to step through each iteration

#### Struct Debugging Best Practices
1. **Expandable view**: Click arrow next to struct in Variables panel
2. **Member watch**: Add specific members to Watch panel
3. **Pointer-to-struct**: Watch both `ptr` and `ptr->member`
4. **Memory layout**: Use memory view to see how struct is arranged

### Sample Debugging Session

**Example Program:**
```cpp
#include <cstdio>

struct Point {
    int x, y;
};

int main() {
    Point p = {10, 20};        // Breakpoint here
    Point* ptr = &p;           // Step to here
    
    ptr->x = 30;               // Watch ptr->x change
    printf("Point: (%d, %d)\n", p.x, p.y);
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Debugging Steps:**
1. **F5** to start debugging
2. **Variables panel**: Expand `p` to see x=10, y=20
3. **F10** to step to pointer assignment
4. **Watch panel**: Add `ptr`, `ptr->x`, `ptr->y`
5. **F10** to step through `ptr->x = 30`
6. **Observe**: Both `p.x` and `ptr->x` change to 30

### Pros and Cons for Chapter 2

## Debugging Strategy by Problem Type

### Array Problems

**All Workflows - Key Debugging Points:**
1. **Array declaration** - Check size and initialization
2. **Loop boundaries** - Watch index variables
3. **Element access** - Monitor `array[index]` values
4. **Bounds violations** - Use Address Sanitizer

**Workflow-Specific Tips:**

**Workflow A (GDB):**
```gdb
(gdb) print array@size          # Show entire array
(gdb) watch array[index]        # Watch specific element
(gdb) info locals              # Show all local variables
```

**Workflow B/C (VS Code):**
- Variables panel shows array contents visually
- Watch panel for `array[i]` during loops
- Memory view for raw memory layout

### Pointer Problems

**All Workflows - Essential Checks:**
1. **Pointer initialization** - Is it null?
2. **Address relationships** - Does pointer point where expected?
3. **Dereferencing safety** - Check before using *ptr
4. **Pointer arithmetic** - Verify address calculations

**Advanced Pointer Debugging:**

**Workflow A:**
```gdb
(gdb) print ptr                 # Address stored in pointer
(gdb) print *ptr                # Value at that address
(gdb) print &ptr                # Address of pointer variable itself
(gdb) x/1xw ptr                 # Examine memory at pointer address
```

**Workflow B/C:**
- Variables panel shows pointer expansion
- Watch expressions for pointer arithmetic
- Memory view for address verification

### Struct Problems

**All Workflows - Debug Strategy:**
1. **Member initialization** - Check each member assignment
2. **Memory layout** - Understand struct organization
3. **Pointer-to-struct** - Verify -> vs . usage
4. **Array of structs** - Debug both array and struct aspects

**Struct-Specific Debugging:**

**Workflow A:**
```gdb
(gdb) print struct_var          # Entire struct
(gdb) print struct_var.member   # Specific member
(gdb) print sizeof(struct_var)  # Struct size
```

**Workflow B/C:**
- Expandable struct view in Variables panel
- Individual member watch expressions
- Memory view shows struct layout

---

## Memory Safety Best Practices

### Compile-Time Safety
```bash
# Enable all warnings and treat as errors
g++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Warray-bounds -Wpointer-arith program.cpp
```

### Runtime Safety
```bash
# Address Sanitizer (all platforms)
g++ -g -fsanitize=address program.cpp

# Undefined Behavior Sanitizer
g++ -g -fsanitize=undefined program.cpp

# Combined (recommended for Chapter 2)
g++ -g -fsanitize=address,undefined program.cpp
```

### Static Analysis Integration

**VS Code Extensions:**
- **clangd** - Real-time static analysis
- **Clang-Tidy** - Additional checks
- **Error Lens** - Inline error display

**Command Line Tools:**
```bash
# Static analysis with clang-tidy
clang-tidy program.cpp -- -std=c++17

# Additional analysis with cppcheck
cppcheck --enable=all program.cpp
```

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Address Sanitizer not working"

**Check compilation flags:**
```bash
g++ -g -fsanitize=address -o program program.cpp
# Make sure both -g and -fsanitize=address are present
```

**Platform-specific issues:**
- **Windows**: May need different MinGW version
- **macOS**: Use clang++ instead of g++
- **Linux**: Should work with GCC 4.8+

### "Can't see variable values in debugger"

**Possible causes:**
1. **Missing debug symbols**: Add -g flag
2. **Optimization enabled**: Remove -O flags or use -O0
3. **Variable optimized away**: Declare as volatile
4. **Out of scope**: Check variable scope

### "Memory view not available"

**Solutions:**
- **Install Hex Editor extension** in VS Code
- **Use GDB memory commands**: `x/10x &variable`
- **Check variable is in scope** when accessing memory view

## Performance Considerations

### Debug vs Release Builds

**Debug Build (for learning):**
```bash
g++ -g -O0 -fsanitize=address program.cpp
```
- Slow execution but excellent debugging
- All variables preserved
- Address Sanitizer overhead

**Release Build (for performance):**
```bash
g++ -O2 -DNDEBUG program.cpp
```
- Fast execution but limited debugging
- Variables may be optimized away
- No sanitizer overhead

### Memory Debugging Overhead

**Address Sanitizer Impact:**
- **Memory usage**: 2-3x increase
- **Execution speed**: 2x slower
- **Binary size**: Larger due to instrumentation

**When to use:**
- ✅ During development and debugging
- ✅ For all Chapter 2 learning exercises
- ❌ In production or performance testing
