# C++ Programming Course - CSCI 330

A comprehensive C++ programming course based on "C++ Crash Course" by Josh Lospinoso.

## 📚 Course Structure

This repository contains complete course materials for teaching/learning C++ programming:

### For Students
- **Chapter Materials** (`chapter_XX_complete.md`) - Comprehensive guides for each chapter
- **Practice Problems** (`chapter_XX_problems.md`) - Hands-on coding exercises
- **Quick Help** (`chapter_XX_quick_help.md`) - Troubleshooting and quick reference
- **Solutions** (`chapter_XX_solutions/`) - Complete solutions with explanations
- **Development Setup** (`chapter_01_development_setup.md`) - Complete setup guide

### For Instructors
- **Instructor Resources** (`instructor/`) - Lesson plans, rubrics, Canvas integration
- **Assignment Templates** (`csci330_f25/`) - Docker-based assignment structure
- **Assessment Tools** - Competency assessments and grading rubrics

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Students
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `./test_integration.sh` to verify your environment
3. Follow the setup guide in `chapter_01_development_setup.md`
4. Start with `GETTING_STARTED.md`
5. Work through chapters sequentially

### Instructors
1. Review materials in the `instructor/` folder
2. See `instructor/INSTRUCTOR_GUIDE.md` for course management
3. Canvas integration guides available for LMS setup

## 📖 Chapters

1. **Up and Running** - Development environment, first programs
2. **Types** - Fundamental types, arrays, strings
3. **Reference Types** - Pointers and references
4. **Object Lifecycle** - RAII, constructors, destructors
5. **Runtime Polymorphism** - Interfaces, virtual functions
6. **Compile-Time Polymorphism** - Templates
7. **Expressions** - Operators and expressions
8. **Statements** - Control flow
9. **Functions** - Function programming, lambdas
10. **Testing** - Unit testing with Catch2
11. **Smart Pointers** - Modern memory management
12. **Utilities** - Standard library utilities
13. **Containers** - STL containers
14. **Iterators** - Iterator patterns

## 🛠️ Development Environment

The course supports three development approaches:
1. **Docker + VS Code** (Recommended) - Consistent environment with IDE features
2. **Docker CLI** - Pure command-line development
3. **Local Setup** - Traditional local compiler installation

All approaches are documented in the setup guide.
